  <h2>Beloved</h2>
  <p>
    “124 was spiteful. Full of a baby’s venom. The women in the house knew it and so did the children. For years each put up with the spite in his own way, but by 1873 <strong>Sethe and her daughter <u>Denver</u></strong> were its only victims.”</p><p>“To Sethe, the future was a matter of keeping the past at bay. The “better life” she believed she and Denver were living was simply not that other one. The fact that Paul D had come out of “that other one” into her bed was better too; and the notion of a future with him, or for that matter without him, was beginning to stroke her mind. As for Denver, the job Sethe had of keeping her from the past that was still waiting for her was all that mattered.” - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beloved_(novel)" target="_blank" title="Beloved wikipedia">Beloved</a>
